# automated_parkinglot
I designed and implemented a backend system for an automated parking lot.
  Each floor may have a different ceiling height and a different 
total weight capacity.
 There is only one entrance to the lot, but additional entrances might be added later.
  Any client car, when it arrives at the parking building, gets automatically scanned. Its weight 
and height are passed to the system as the car approaches the gate. The system must 
assign the approaching car to the best suitable spot and calculate the resulting price per 
minute.
